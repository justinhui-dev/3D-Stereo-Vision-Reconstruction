3D Stereo Vision Reconstruction

Introduction
This repository contains code for generating a 3D reconstruction model from two stereo left and right images. The feature points are extracted using the OpenCV Swift detector.

Features
Stereo Images Processing: The Python script 3D-Reconstruction.py processes two stereo left and right images to generate a 3D reconstruction model.
Feature Point Detection: Utilizes the OpenCV Swift detector to extract feature points from the input images.
Easy-to-Use: With clear documentation and straightforward usage instructions, this repository makes 3D reconstruction accessible to developers of all levels.
Usage
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D-Stereo-Vision-Reconstruction.git
Navigate to the cloned directory:

bash
Copy code
cd 3D-Stereo-Vision-Reconstruction
Execute the Python script with two stereo left and right images as input:

bash
Copy code
python 3D-Reconstruction.py left_image.jpg right_image.jpg
The script will generate a 3D reconstruction model as output.
